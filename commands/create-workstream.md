# Create Implementation Plan Document

Have the @agent-parallel-work-orchestrator review $ARGUMENTS documents and create an implementation plan document that:

  1. Breaks down all recommended refactorings into parallel workstreams
  2. Assigns each workstream to an appropriate developer and code reviewer agents
  3. Includes iterative quality loop for each workstream:
    - developer agent implements changes
    - coder reviewer agent reviews and provides feedback
    - Loop repeats until code reviewer approval

## Requirements

- Prioritize by impact/risk
- Define clear success criteria per workstream
- Ensure workstreams are truly parallel (minimal dependencies)
- Include validation checkpoints between phases

## Document Structure Requirements

- Include a Table of Contents at the top with line number ranges for each major section
- Add a line number range indicator at the top showing where the TOC is located
- Each TOC entry must include the line number range where that section can be found
- At the beginning of the plan, include clear instructions for agents on how to use grep to extract only the sections they need based on line numbers
- Format example: "Lines 1-25: Table of Contents" and "Lines 26-150: Workstream 1 - Authentication Refactoring"

## Output: Implementation plan document with

- Line-numbered Table of Contents (with range indicator at top)
- Agent context retrieval instructions at the beginning
- Workstream definitions with line number ranges
- Agent assignments and review loops
