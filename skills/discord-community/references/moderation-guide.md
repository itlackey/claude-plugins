# Moderation & Community Management Guide

## Moderation Philosophy for Indie TTRPG Communities

### Core Principles

1. **Community over rules-lawyering**
   - Spirit of the law matters more than letter
   - Context matters for every situation
   - People make mistakes, guide don't punish first

2. **Transparent but not performative**
   - Explain actions when asked
   - Don't make drama public spectacle
   - DM explanations for sensitive issues

3. **Consistent but flexible**
   - Same rules for everyone (including team)
   - Consider context and intent
   - Patterns matter more than single incidents

4. **Proactive not reactive**
   - Set tone with your presence
   - Guide conversations early
   - Don't wait for things to blow up

5. **Empower the community**
   - Trust members to self-moderate
   - Encourage positive behavior
   - Let community culture emerge naturally

## Common Situations & How to Handle

### The Heated Argument

**Situation:** Two community members getting increasingly hostile

**Response Flow:**
1. **Early intervention (preferred):**
   ```
   Hey folks, let's bring the temperature down a bit. You're both making points, but the tone is getting heated. Take a breather? ‚òï
   ```

2. **If escalating:**
   ```
   @user1 @user2 - Moving this to DMs or taking a break. This is getting too heated for public chat. I've got faith you two can work it out respectfully if you step back.
   ```

3. **If continues:**
   - Short timeout (5-30 min) for both
   - DM each explaining why
   - Offer to mediate in DMs if they want

**Don't:**
- Take sides in the argument
- Let it go too long
- Punish just one person unless clearly at fault

### The Complainer

**Situation:** Someone constantly negative about game design choices

**Response:**
- First few times: Engage genuinely, explain design reasoning
- If pattern: Private DM checking in
  ```
  Hey [user], noticed you've had a lot of concerns about [feature]. Want to hop in DMs and talk through it? Happy to explain the design thinking, but also want to make sure you're enjoying being here!
  ```
- If toxic: 
  ```
  [User], I appreciate feedback, but the constant negativity is affecting the community vibe. If Dimm City isn't for you, no hard feelings! But we need this space to be constructive. Can you work with me on that?
  ```

**Don't:**
- Dismiss all criticism as negativity
- Let them poison the well
- Ban for being critical (unless truly toxic)

### The Overeager Fan

**Situation:** Someone dominating every conversation, answering all questions, making it hard for others

**Response:**
1. **Private appreciation + gentle redirect:**
   ```
   Hey [user]! Love your enthusiasm for Dimm City - you're one of our most active members! üñ§
   
   One small thing: I want to make sure newer folks feel comfortable jumping in too. Maybe give others a chance to answer questions first? Your knowledge is amazing, but I'd love to see more voices in the mix.
   
   Think of it as letting others roll their own dice, y'know? üòä
   ```

**Don't:**
- Publicly call them out
- Discourage participation entirely
- Let them inadvertently drive others away

### The Lurker Concern

**Situation:** Someone worries they're "lurking" and not contributing

**Response:**
```
Lurking is totally fine! Not everyone wants to chat constantly, and that's okay. You're still part of the community.

Post when you feel like it - no pressure. Sometimes just being here and reading is all you want, and we're cool with that. The city has room for everyone. üåÜ
```

### The "Where's My Stuff?"

**Situation:** Backer asking about pledge rewards, shipping, etc.

**Response:**
```
Hey [user]! Let's move this to #customer-support so we can help you properly.

[In support channel]
Thanks for backing Dimm City! Can you share:
- Your Kickstarter backer number or email
- Which tier you backed
- Specific question

We'll get you sorted! üé≤
```

**Escalate to team if:**
- Payment issues
- Pledge modifications
- Angry or urgent

### The External Drama

**Situation:** Someone brings drama from another server/Twitter/etc.

**Response:**
```
Hey folks, let's keep this server focused on Dimm City. Whatever's happening elsewhere, we're not the place for that discussion. Fresh start here! üåÜ
```

**If they persist:**
- DM warning
- Short timeout if needed
- Make clear: other communities' drama ‚â† relevant here

### The Backseat Moderator

**Situation:** Member tries to enforce rules publicly or mini-mod

**Response:**
1. **If they're right but overstepping:**
   ```
   [Backseat mod]: Hey everyone, please DM them if you disagree instead of clogging chat!
   
   [Mod]: Thanks [user], though we've got this covered! Appreciate you looking out for the community. üòä
   ```

2. **If becoming a pattern (DM):**
   ```
   Hey [user], I appreciate you trying to help enforce rules, but that's what the mod team is for. If you see something, ping us or report it - you don't need to address it publicly. Cool?
   ```

### The "Just Joking"

**Situation:** Someone says something inappropriate, then "just joking!"

**Response:**
```
I get you were joking, but that lands differently in text than you might think. Let's keep the humor in bounds that everyone can enjoy. üëç
```

**If clearly testing boundaries:**
```
[User], "just joking" doesn't make [behavior] okay. Our rules still apply. Consider this a warning.
```

## Proactive Moderation Techniques

- Show appreciation
- Stay positive

**Guide conversations early**

### Positive Reinforcement

**Highlight good behavior:**
```
Love the discussion happening in #game-discussion right now! This is exactly the kind of constructive theorycrafting we're here for. üé≤
```

**Thank helpful members:**
```
Shoutout to @user for always helping answer rules questions! You're making this community awesome. üñ§
```

**Celebrate milestones:**
```
We just hit 500 members! Thanks for making this such a welcoming community, everyone. The city grows! üåÜ
```

## Dealing with Mod Burnout

### Warning Signs

- Dreading checking Discord
- Snapping at minor issues
- Can't enjoy community anymore
- Always seeing problems
- Feeling personally attacked by criticism

### Prevention

**Set boundaries:**
- Specific mod hours
- Days off
- Don't check constantly
- It's OK to miss things

**Share the load:**
- Rotate responsibilities
- Multiple mods cover shifts
- No single point of failure

**Remember why you're here:**
- Love for Dimm City
- Community building
- Fun, not just work

**Take breaks:**
- Regular days off
- Longer breaks if needed
- Not abandoning ship to rest

### Recovery

If burned out:
1. **Acknowledge it** - Tell team
2. **Step back** - Reduce hours or take break
3. **Reassess** - What's causing it?
4. **Adjust** - Change approach or get help
5. **Return** - When ready, not guilty

It's better to moderate less but sustainably than burn out and disappear.

Special shoutout to:
‚Ä¢ @user1 for always welcoming new members
‚Ä¢ @user2 for incredible fan art
‚Ä¢ @user3 for answering approximately 10,000 rules questions

But really, every single one of you makes this place special. The city thanks you. (The city is terrifying, but grateful.) üñ§

Here's to the next thousand. üåÜüé≤

- Matt, Todd, and the whole Dimm City team
```

This is what it's all about. üñ§
