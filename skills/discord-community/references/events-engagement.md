## Special Considerations for Small Teams

### You Can't Do Everything
**Prioritize:**
1. Respond to questions (helpful)
2. Welcome new people (welcoming)
3. Share updates (informative)
4. Occasional events (fun)
5. Everything else (nice to have)

### Set Realistic Expectations
**With community:**
- Response times may vary
- Not 24/7 monitoring
- Doing best you can
- Appreciate patience

**With yourself:**
- Can't be everywhere always
- Quality over quantity
- It's OK to miss things
- Community can self-moderate

### Leverage Community
**Empower helpful members:**
- Thank them publicly
- Consider trusted mod roles
- Let them run events
- Answer questions

**Community-run activities:**
- LFG postings
- Art shares
- Theory discussions
- Fan content

**You guide, they grow:**
- Set culture and tone
- Provide structure
- Step back when working
- Trust the community

### Batch Your Time
**Set specific times to:**
- Check all channels (15 min)
- Respond to questions (20 min)
- Post updates (10 min)
- Plan events (weekly 30 min)

**Rather than:**
- Constantly checking
- Scattered attention
- Burning out
- Never being "off"
