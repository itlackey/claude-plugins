## Common Tasks

### Task 1: Welcoming New Members

**When:** Someone joins the server

**Quick response:**
```
Welcome to Dimm City, [username]! 🌆

Glad you're here! Feel free to introduce yourself in #introductions and jump into any conversation.

Are you a Kickstarter backer? Let us know in #customer-support so we can give you access to backer channels!

The city is dark, but the community is friendly. 🖤
```

**Why it matters:**
- First impression sets tone
- Makes people feel seen
- Encourages participation
- Builds welcoming culture

**Detailed guidance:** `server-structure.md` → "Welcome Experience"

### Task 2: Moderating Rule Violations

**Assessment framework:**
1. **Is this a violation?** Check against rules
2. **How serious?** Minor, moderate, serious, or immediate ban
3. **First time or pattern?** Check user history
4. **Context?** What led to this?

**Response tiers:**
- **Tier 1 (Minor):** Friendly reminder, no formal warning
- **Tier 2 (Moderate):** Official warning in DM
- **Tier 3 (Serious):** Timeout or temporary ban
- **Tier 4 (Extreme):** Immediate permanent ban

**Example (Tier 1 - Minor):**
```
Hey [user], quick heads up - memes go in #memes-and-shitposts not #game-discussion. No worries though! Just wanted to let you know. 😊
```

**Detailed guidance:** `moderation-guide.md` → "Rule Violation Response Framework"

### Task 3: Keeping Chat Active

**When chat is slow:**

**Daily Activities:**
- Post "Question of the Day"
- Share development update
- Ask what people are playing
- Post relevant meme
- React to recent messages

**Example prompts:**
```
Question of the Day: What's the darkest character concept you've ever played?

Yo, what's everyone's weekend TTRPG plans? 🎲

[Shares piece of concept art] Thoughts on this creature design?
```

**Don't force it:**
- Some slowness is normal
- Community needs breathing room
- Quality over quantity
- Let conversations develop naturally

**Detailed guidance:** `events-engagement.md` → "Daily Engagement Activities"

### Task 4: Planning an Event

**Basic event checklist:**
1. **Decide type:** Game night? Q&A? Playtest? Celebration?
2. **Pick date/time:** Consider time zones, weekday vs weekend
3. **Create Discord event:** Use native event feature
4. **Announce 1 week ahead:** Give people time to plan
5. **Reminder 1 day before:** Keep it top of mind
6. **Day-of reminder:** 1 hour before
7. **Run event:** Be there early, facilitate
8. **Follow up:** Thank everyone, share recap

**Announcement template:**
```
📅 EVENT: [Name]

**When:** [Day, Date] at [Time + Timezone]
**Where:** [Voice/Text Channel]
**What:** [Description]

[Details about what to expect]

Hope to see you there! 🎲
```

**Detailed guidance:** `events-engagement.md` → "Event Planning Checklist"

### Task 5: Responding to Backer Questions

**Determine type:**
- **Pledge/payment:** Direct to Kickstarter support or team
- **Shipping:** Provide timeline, escalate if specific issue
- **Game rules:** Answer directly if you know
- **Access to channels:** Verify backer status, assign role

**Response framework:**
```
Hey [user]! Thanks for backing Dimm City! 🖤

[Answer their question clearly]

[If you need to escalate: Let me check with the team and get back to you]

[If they need access: I'll get you set up with the @Backer role right now!]

Let me know if you need anything else!

-[Name]
```

**Keep #customer-support organized:**
- Use threads for complex issues
- Mark resolved issues
- Follow up within 24 hours
- Escalate to dev team when needed

**Detailed guidance:** `server-structure.md` → "Category: FEEDBACK & SUPPORT"

### Task 6: Handling Conflict

**When two members argue:**

**Early intervention (best):**
```
Hey folks, let's bring the temperature down a bit. You're both making points, but the tone is getting heated. Take a breather? ☕
```

**If escalates:**
```
@user1 @user2 - Moving this to DMs or taking a break. This is getting too heated for public chat.
```

**If continues:**
- Short timeout for both (5-30 min)
- DM each explaining why
- Don't take sides unless clear violation

**Don't:**
- Let it go too long
- Publicly shame either person
- Take sides in argument
- Ban without warning (unless extreme)

**Detailed guidance:** `moderation-guide.md` → "Common Situations"

## Working With Small Teams

### You Can't Do Everything

**Prioritize:**
1. Respond to questions (helpful)
2. Welcome new people (welcoming)
3. Share updates (informative)
4. Occasional events (fun)
5. Everything else (nice to have)

### Set Boundaries

**With community:**
- Response times may vary
- Not 24/7 monitoring
- Doing best you can

**With yourself:**
- Can't be everywhere
- Quality over quantity
- It's OK to miss things
- Community can self-moderate

### Leverage Community

- Thank helpful members
- Let them run events
- Empower answers
- Trust them to be awesome

### Batch Your Time

**Set specific times:**
- Check all channels (15 min)
- Respond to questions (20 min)
- Post updates (10 min)
- Plan events (weekly 30 min)

**Rather than:**
- Constantly checking
- Scattered attention
- Burning out

**Guidance:** `events-engagement.md` → "Special Considerations for Small Teams"
