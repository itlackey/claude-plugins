# Print Quality Checklist

## Visual Review Methodology

### Page-by-Page Review Process

**Three-Pass System:**

**Pass 1: Structural Review** (Fast scan)
- Page numbering sequence
- Chapter/section breaks
- Blank pages (intended vs errors)
- Obvious layout breaks
- Missing content

**Pass 2: Detailed Review** (Thorough)
- Margins and safe zones
- Typography and spacing
- Images and graphics
- Headers and footers
- Alignment and consistency

**Pass 3: Edge Cases** (Critical check)
- First/last pages of sections
- Pages with complex layouts
- Color vs B&W pages
- Special elements (tables, sidebars)
- Reference elements (TOC, index)

---

## Margins and Safe Zones

### Standard Margin Requirements

**For Perfect Binding (Most Common):**
- **Inner margin (gutter):** 0.75" - 1" (18-25mm)
- **Outer margin:** 0.5" - 0.75" (13-18mm)
- **Top margin:** 0.5" - 0.75" (13-18mm)
- **Bottom margin:** 0.75" - 1" (18-25mm)

**For Saddle Stitch:**
- **All margins:** 0.5" minimum (13mm)
- **Center gutter:** 0.25" (6mm)

**For Coil/Spiral Binding:**
- **Binding edge:** 0.75" - 1" (18-25mm)
- **Other margins:** 0.5" minimum (13mm)

### Critical Issues to Flag

❌ **Content in bleed area**
- Text within 0.125" (3mm) of trim
- Important graphics too close to edge
- Will be cut off during trimming

❌ **Content in gutter**
- Text lost in binding
- Images spanning gutter poorly
- Hard to read when book opens

❌ **Inconsistent margins**
- Left pages different from right
- Section breaks changing margins
- Unintended margin shifts

### How to Check

**Visual Method:**
1. Look at page edges - is content too close?
2. Check inner edge - can text be read when bound?
3. Compare left/right pages - are margins symmetric?
4. Verify chapter starts - do they use different margins?

**Measurement Method:**
1. Use ruler tool in PDF viewer
2. Measure from edge to first content
3. Check against spec requirements
4. Document any violations

**Things That Should Touch Edges:**
✓ Background colors/images (if intended)
✓ Full-bleed images
✓ Decorative elements

**Things That Should NOT Touch Edges:**
✗ Body text
✗ Important images
✗ Page numbers (unless design choice)
✗ Headers/footers with critical info

---

## Typography and Text

### Font and Size Check

**Body Text:**
- **Minimum size:** 9pt (8pt acceptable for captions)
- **Maximum size:** 12pt (unless large print edition)
- **Line height:** 1.2-1.5x font size
- **Recommended:** 10-11pt for most books

**Headers:**
- **H1 (Chapter):** 18-24pt
- **H2 (Section):** 14-18pt
- **H3 (Subsection):** 12-14pt
- Hierarchy must be clear

**Special Text:**
- **Captions:** 8-9pt acceptable
- **Footnotes:** 8-9pt
- **Sidebars:** 9-10pt
- **Pull quotes:** Larger or styled differently

### Issues to Flag

❌ **Too small to read**
- Body text under 9pt
- Critical info under 8pt
- Text shrunk to fit space

❌ **Inconsistent sizing**
- Body text varies between pages
- Same-level headers different sizes
- Random size changes

❌ **Poor hierarchy**
- H2 larger than H1
- All headers same size
- Body text same size as headers

❌ **Line length issues**
- Too long (over 75 characters)
- Too short (under 40 characters)
- Causes eye strain

### Spacing Issues

**Line Spacing (Leading):**
- Too tight: Lines touching or nearly touching
- Too loose: Disconnected paragraphs
- Inconsistent: Changes mid-page

**Paragraph Spacing:**
- Inconsistent spacing between paragraphs
- Too much space (looks disconnected)
- Too little space (hard to distinguish)

**Word Spacing:**
- Rivers (white space flowing through text)
- Too tight (words running together)
- Too loose (words too far apart)

**Widows and Orphans:**
- **Widow:** Single line at top of page (avoid)
- **Orphan:** Single line at bottom of page (avoid)
- Should be at least 2-3 lines

### Font Usage

**Good Practices:**
✓ 1-2 fonts maximum (body + headers)
✓ Consistent font throughout
✓ Font appropriate to content
✓ Readable at intended size

**Issues to Flag:**
✗ Too many fonts (looks amateur)
✗ Font changes mid-document
✗ Decorative fonts for body text
✗ Poor font pairings

## Page Numbering

### Placement Check

**Standard Positions:**
- Bottom center (most common)
- Bottom outer corners (recto/verso)
- Top outer corners
- Top center

**Rules:**
- Consistent position throughout
- Easy to find when flipping
- Not in margins that get cut

### Numbering Issues

❌ **Missing page numbers**
- Pages that should have them don't
- Skipped in sequence

❌ **Incorrect numbering**
- Numbers out of sequence
- Duplicate page numbers
- Wrong starting number

❌ **Inconsistent formatting**
- Some pages with, some without
- Different positions
- Different styles

### Special Cases

**Pages Without Numbers (Acceptable):**
✓ Title page
✓ Copyright page
✓ Blank pages
✓ Full-bleed images (sometimes)
✓ Chapter openers (design choice)

**Roman vs Arabic:**
- Frontmatter: typically lowercase roman (i, ii, iii)
- Main content: Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3)
- Should restart at 1 for main content

---

## Headers and Footers

### Content Check

**What Should Be There:**
- Book/chapter title
- Section title
- Author name
- Page numbers
- Publication info (if applicable)

**Left Page (Verso) Typically:**

❌ **Too large/prominent**
- Headers competing with body text

- Should be on all body pages

### First Page Exceptions

**Chapter/Section First Pages:**

---

## Images and Graphics

### Quality Check

**Resolution:**
- **Minimum for print:** 300 DPI

❌ **Poor cropping**
- Important parts cut off
- Awkward framing
- Unintended elements included

❌ **Misaligned**
- Not aligned with text

- Inconsistent positioning

### Captions and Labels

**Should Have:**
- Every image has caption (if applicable)
- Figure numbers consistent
- Clear relationship to text

**Check For:**

---

## Tables and Data

### Readability

**Font Size:**
- Table text at least 8pt
- Headers at least 9pt
- Critical info at least 9pt

**Cell Spacing:**
- Adequate padding in cells
- Not cramped
- Not too loose

### Structure

❌ **Too wide for page**

- Alignment changes

### Headers and Context

**Continued Tables:**
✓ "Table X continued" label
✓ Headers repeat on new page
✓ Context clear even mid-table

**Standalone Tables:**

✓ Positioned near reference

---

## Page Breaks

### Good Breaks

✓ **At natural divisions**
- End of chapter
- End of section
- After complete thought
- Before new topic

✓ **Strategic placement**
- Chapter starts on recto (right page)
- Important content on recto
- Symmetry in spreads

### Bad Breaks

❌ **Mid-thought**
- Sentence splits across pages
- Paragraph orphaned
- Incomplete idea

❌ **Visual disruption**
- Image caption separated from image
- List items split awkwardly
- Table header on one page, data on next

❌ **Heading isolation**
- Heading at bottom with no text
- Subheading separated from content
- "Orphan" headers

### Checking Method

1. **Flip through PDF page by page**
2. **Look for awkward breaks**
3. **Check if content flows naturally**
4. **Verify headings have at least 2-3 lines of text after**

---

## Consistency Across Pages

### Visual Rhythm

**Should Be Consistent:**
- Margins (unless intentional change)
- Text column width
- Line spacing
- Header/footer position
- Font sizes
- Color scheme

**Can Vary:**
- Chapter openers (often special)
- Full-page images
- Special sections (appendix, etc.)
- Intentional design changes

### Common Inconsistencies

❌ **Random shifts**
- One page slightly different margin
- Font size changes unexpectedly
- Spacing varies without reason

❌ **Section confusion**
- Unclear where sections change
- Inconsistent section styling
- Missing section indicators

❌ **Page template errors**
- Different templates used accidentally
- Template elements missing
- Elements in wrong positions

---

## Color and Printing

### Color Mode Check

**For Color Printing:**
- Document in CMYK (not RGB)
- Colors print-safe (not too bright)
- Black text is 100% K (not 4-color black)

**For B&W Printing:**
- Images convert well to grayscale
- Sufficient contrast maintained
- No color-dependent information

### Common Color Issues

❌ **RGB instead of CMYK**
- Colors will shift when printed
- Unpredictable results
- Usually darker/muddier

❌ **Out-of-gamut colors**
- Colors too bright for print
- Will be clipped/changed
- Screen doesn't match print

❌ **Four-color black**
- Black text using C+M+Y+K
- Can look muddy
- Registration issues
- Should be K only

### Bleed and Trim

**Bleed Area:**
- 0.125" (3mm) beyond trim
- Full-bleed images extend into bleed
- Background colors extend into bleed

**Trim Area:**
- Where page will be cut
- Nothing critical should be here
- 0.125" safety margin inside trim

**Safe Zone:**
- At least 0.25" inside trim
- All text and important graphics here
- Ensures nothing gets cut

---

## Special Pages
