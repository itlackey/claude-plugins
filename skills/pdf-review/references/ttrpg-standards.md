# TTRPG Book Layout Standards

## Genre-Specific Considerations

### TTRPG Books Are Different

Unlike novels, TTRPG books are:
- **Reference materials** - Flipped through, not read linearly
- **Heavily illustrated** - Art is critical to mood and understanding
- **Complex layouts** - Tables, sidebars, stat blocks, multiple columns
- **Functionally designed** - Usability matters as much as aesthetics
- **Art-forward** - Visual design carries theme and tone

---

## Page Layout Standards

### Two-Column vs Single-Column

**Two-Column (Most Common for TTRPGs):**
- Better for dense information
- Easier to scan quickly
- Allows for flexible sidebars
- More professional appearance
- Standard: 2 columns with 0.25"-0.5" gutter

**Single-Column (Sometimes Used):**
- Narrative sections
- Introduction/fiction
- Simple rule explanations
- Large tables that need width

**When to Mix:**
- Chapter intros often single-column
- Main rules two-column
- Appendices might vary
- Full-page spreads single-column

### Column Width

**Ideal:**
- 45-75 characters per line
- Wider = harder to read
- Narrower = too choppy

**Check:**
- Count characters in typical line
- Adjust font size or column width
- Consider audience (younger = larger)

---

## Stat Blocks and Game Mechanics

### Stat Block Formatting

**Essential Elements:**
- **Clear header** - Monster/NPC name prominent
- **Consistent structure** - Same order every time
- **Visual separation** - Background color, border, or spacing
- **Readable stats** - Large enough to see quickly
- **Icon/symbol use** - Consistent throughout

**Good Practices:**
✓ Box or background to separate from body text
✓ Bold labels for stats
✓ Consistent ordering (HP, AC, Speed, etc.)
✓ Icons for quick recognition
✓ Reference page numbers for abilities

**Issues to Flag:**
❌ Stat blocks breaking across pages
❌ Inconsistent formatting between blocks
❌ Stats too small to read quickly
❌ No visual distinction from body text
❌ Different stat order than rest of book

### Dice Notation and Mechanics

**Formatting Standards:**
- **Dice:** Bold or distinct color (d20, 3d6)
- **DC values:** Clear and prominent
- **Keywords:** Bold or italicized consistently
- **Damage:** Format consistently (2d6 + 3)

**Check For:**
- Consistent notation style
- Easy to spot during gameplay
- Not lost in paragraph text
- Clear mathematical operations

### Tables and Charts

**TTRPG-Specific Tables:**
- Random encounter tables
- Loot tables
- Character creation tables
- Reference charts
- Experience tables

**Good Practices:**
✓ Headers repeat on continued pages
✓ Zebra striping for readability
✓ Adequate cell padding
✓ Font size at least 8pt
✓ Positioned near text reference
✓ Landscape orientation if needed

**Common Issues:**
❌ Too wide for page
❌ Font too small
❌ No header on continued pages
❌ Poor contrast in cells
❌ Inconsistent border styles

## Sidebars and Call-Out Boxes

### Purpose and Types

**Sidebar Types:**
- **Optional rules** - Variants and house rules
- **Designer notes** - Behind-the-scenes insights
- **Examples of play** - Showing mechanics in action
- **Lore tidbits** - World-building details
- **GM tips** - Advice for running the game

### Visual Styling

**Essential:**
- **Different background** - Color, tint, or texture
- **Border or separation** - Clear visual boundary
- **Distinct typography** - Different font or size
- **Title/header** - "Optional Rule:" "Example:" etc.
- **Icon/symbol** - Quick identification

**Layout Rules:**
✓ Don't break across pages if possible
✓ Position near relevant text
✓ Not wider than column (unless full-width)
✓ Consistent styling throughout book
✓ Easy to distinguish from main text

**Issues to Flag:**
❌ Sidebars in margins
❌ Breaking awkwardly across pages
❌ Different styles throughout book
❌ No clear purpose/label
❌ Too similar to body text

---

## Art and Illustrations

### Art Placement for TTRPGs

**Full-Page Art:**
- Chapter openers

### Bleeding and Borders

**Full-Bleed Images:**
✓ Extend to 0.125" past trim
✓ No important details in bleed area
✓ Entire edge covered
✓ Used intentionally for impact

**Bordered Images:**
✓ At least 0.25" from page edge
✓ Consistent border width
✓ Border style matches book design
✓ Not too close to other elements

### Art Integration

**Good Practices:**
✓ Art supports text (doesn't contradict)
✓ Placed near relevant content
✓ Doesn't disrupt text flow unnecessarily
✓ Captions when needed for clarity
✓ Artist credit included (somewhere)

**Issues to Check:**
❌ Art cuts off character faces/details
❌ Low resolution (pixelated)
❌ Color doesn't match book palette
❌ Awkward text wrapping around art

❌ Too many spreads with same layout
❌ Art clustered in one section
❌ Inconsistent density

### Spread Design

**Facing Pages Work Together:**
- Visual balance across spread
- Related content on facing pages
- Art doesn't compete
- Text flows naturally

**Check:**
- Do spreads look intentional?
- Is there visual variety?
- Does flow make sense?
- Are spreads too similar throughout?
