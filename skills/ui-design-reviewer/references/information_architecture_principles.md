# Information Architecture Principles

Guide for evaluating content organization, navigation, and findability.

## Core IA Principles

### 1. Organization Schemes
- **Alphabetical**: A-Z listings
- **Chronological**: Time-based ordering
- **Topical**: By subject matter
- **Task-oriented**: By user goals
- **Audience-based**: By user type

### 2. Navigation Structures
- **Hierarchical**: Tree structure, parent-child relationships
- **Sequential**: Linear flow, step-by-step
- **Web/Network**: Interconnected, many paths
- **Hub-and-spoke**: Central dashboard with branching

### 3. Labeling Best Practices
- Use user language, not jargon
- Be specific and descriptive
- Keep consistent across site
- Avoid ambiguous terms
- Test with real users

### 4. Search & Filtering
- Provide search for >50 items
- Offer relevant filters
- Show result counts
- Allow sort options
- Preserve filter state

### 5. Mental Models
- Match user expectations
- Follow web conventions
- Be consistent with category standards
- Use familiar patterns

## Evaluation Criteria

**Findability (1-5):**
1: Can't find anything easily
5: Everything easily discoverable

**Navigation Clarity (1-5):**
1: Confusing, gets lost
5: Always know where you are

**Information Scent (1-5):**
1: Labels don't indicate content
5: Perfect indication of destination

## Common IA Issues
- Too many nav levels (overwhelming)
- Unclear labels (ambiguous)
- No search (poor findability)
- Inconsistent categorization
- No breadcrumbs (lost context)
- Dead ends (no next step)
