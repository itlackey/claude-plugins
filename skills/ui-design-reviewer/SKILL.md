## Review Process

The design review follows these steps:

1. **Plan the review** - Define scope, authentication, agents to deploy, and pages to review
2. **Capture visual state** - Screenshot all pages and key interaction states
3. **Extract structural data** - Get HTML for technical analysis
4. **Deploy design agents** - Each agent reviews from their perspective
5. **Synthesize findings** - Combine insights across agents
6. **Generate report** - Create comprehensive design review with prioritized recommendations

## Step 1: Planning the Design Review

### Determine Scope

Ask the user to clarify:
- Application URL and key pages to review
- Authentication requirements (JWT token file or credentials)
- Which design agents to deploy (all six or subset)
- Specific design concerns or focus areas
- Target devices/viewports to evaluate
- Brand guidelines or design system (if available)

### Select Design Agents

**Full Review** (deploy all agents):
- Comprehensive evaluation from all perspectives
- Best for initial audits or major redesigns
- Expect 60-90 minutes for thorough review

**Targeted Review** (select specific agents):
- Visual + Interaction for visual design polish
- Accessibility + Responsive for compliance
- IA + Interaction for UX flow improvements
- Choose based on known concerns

### Authentication Setup

**JWT Authentication:**
1. Get path to JWT token JSON file from user
2. Read token file (format: `{"token": "jwt-string"}`)
3. Inject authorization headers using chrome_evaluate (see chrome_mcp_guide.md)
4. Verify authentication with test navigation

**Form-Based Authentication:**
1. Navigate to login page
2. Fill credentials
3. Submit and verify
4. Proceed with authenticated session

### Load Design Context (Optional)

If user provides design system or brand guidelines:
1. Ask for file paths or URLs
2. Review design tokens, color palettes, typography scales
3. Use as reference during agent evaluations
4. Check for consistency with established patterns

## Step 2: Capture Visual State

Screenshots are critical for design review - capture comprehensively.

### Screenshot Strategy

**Essential Captures:**
- Homepage / landing page (above fold and full page)
- Main navigation (expanded states)
- All key user flows (signup, dashboard, settings, etc.)
- Forms (empty, filled, error, success states)
- Modals and overlays (all variations)
- Data tables and lists (empty, populated, loading states)
- Interactive components (buttons, dropdowns, tooltips in various states)
- Mobile viewport (if responsive review requested)

**State Variations:**
- Default/rest state
- Hover state (when possible)
- Active/pressed state
- Disabled state
- Focus state (for keyboard navigation)
- Error state
- Success/confirmation state
- Loading state

### Capture Pattern

```
For each page/component:
1. Navigate and wait for full render
2. Capture default state screenshot
3. Trigger hover states (use chrome_hover)
4. Capture hover screenshot
5. Trigger interactions (clicks, fills)
6. Capture interactive state screenshots
7. Extract HTML for technical analysis
8. Name screenshots descriptively (e.g., homepage_hero.png, signup_errors.png)
```

### Viewport Variations

If responsive review requested:

```javascript
// Desktop (1920x1080)
await chrome_evaluate('window.resizeTo(1920, 1080)');
await chrome_screenshot(); // desktop_page.png

// Tablet (768x1024)
await chrome_evaluate('window.resizeTo(768, 1024)');
await chrome_screenshot(); // tablet_page.png

// Mobile (375x667)
await chrome_evaluate('window.resizeTo(375, 667)');
await chrome_screenshot(); // mobile_page.png
```

## Step 3: Extract Structural Data

Get HTML for technical analysis alongside visual review.

### HTML Extraction Pattern

```
For each page:
1. After screenshot capture, get HTML using chrome_get_html
2. Save with matching name (page_name.html)
3. Extract computed styles for key elements (if needed)
4. Note any JavaScript-driven behavior
```

### Computed Styles Extraction

For key elements, capture computed styles:

```javascript
const styles = await chrome_evaluate(`
  const el = document.querySelector('.primary-button');
  const computed = window.getComputedStyle(el);
  ({
    color: computed.color,
    backgroundColor: computed.backgroundColor,
    fontSize: computed.fontSize,
    fontFamily: computed.fontFamily,
    padding: computed.padding,
    borderRadius: computed.borderRadius,
    boxShadow: computed.boxShadow
  });
`);
```

## Step 4: Deploy Design Agents

Each agent conducts their specialized review.

### Agent Review Process

- Major visual hierarchy problems causing confusion
- Navigation that blocks critical features

**High Priority (Address Soon):**
- Accessibility issues (WCAG AA failures)
- Interaction pattern inconsistencies
- Visual design polish needs affecting credibility
- IA improvements for findability
- Responsive issues on key devices

**Medium Priority (Plan for Next Iteration):**
- Accessibility enhancements (WCAG AAA)
- Micro-interaction refinements
- Visual design optimization
- IA enhancements for efficiency
- Brand expression improvements

**Low Priority (Future Consideration):**

### Report Quality Standards

**Be Specific:**
```
Bad: "Button spacing needs improvement"
Good: "Primary buttons have 8px padding but should have 12px vertical and 24px horizontal padding for optimal touch targets (44x44px minimum)"
```

**Provide Examples:**
```
Bad: "Colors clash"
Good: "The red CTA button (#FF0000) clashes with the purple header (#7B2CBF). Recommend using brand teal (#00B4D8) for CTAs to maintain harmony"
```

**Reference Screenshots:**
```
Issue: Visual hierarchy unclear in hero section
Screenshot: homepage_hero.png
Problem: Headline (32px) and CTA text (30px) are too similar in size
Recommendation: Increase headline to 48px, reduce CTA to 16px
```
