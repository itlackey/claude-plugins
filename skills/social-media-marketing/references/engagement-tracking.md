## Response Best Practices

### The 3-Part Response Framework

**1. Acknowledge**
- Use their name if possible
- Recognize their specific point
- Show you actually read their comment

**2. Answer/Address**
- Provide clear, helpful information
- Be specific, not vague
- Link to resources if relevant

**3. Engage Further**
- Ask a follow-up question
- Invite them to join community
- Thank them
- Add personal touch

**Example:**
```
Hey Sarah! Great question about character creation.

You get to customize your creature using our modular system - pick body type, abilities, and quirks. It's designed to be simple but give tons of variety.

Have you thought about what kind of creature you'd want to play? We'd love to hear ideas! And if you haven't yet, join our Discord - lots of folks are sharing character concepts there.

-Matt
```

### Response Tone Guidelines

**When to be:**
- **Casual & fun:** General community interaction, non-critical topics
- **Professional but warm:** Questions about pledges, fulfillment, timelines
- **Empathetic:** Concerns, complaints, or disappointments  
- **Educational:** Rules questions, design explanations
- **Enthusiastic:** Positive feedback, fan content, milestone celebrations

### Red Flags to Watch For

**Escalating Quickly:**
- "This is unacceptable..."
- "I'm canceling my pledge..."
- Multiple negative comments in short time
- Tagging others or calling for action

**Action:** Respond immediately, take to DMs if needed, get team input

**Misinformation Spreading:**
- "I heard that..."
- Misunderstanding of rules/tiers
- Incorrect shipping info

**Action:** Politely correct with facts, link to official info

**Community Conflict:**
- Arguments in comments
- Personal attacks
- Off-topic drama

**Action:** Step in professionally, remind of community guidelines, DM if needed

## Engagement Strategies

### Driving Kickstarter Traffic

**Call-to-Action (CTA) Hierarchy:**
1. **Primary:** "Back the game: [link]"
2. **Secondary:** "Learn more: dimm.city"  
3. **Tertiary:** "Join our Discord: [link]"

**CTA Placement:**
- Facebook: End of post, sometimes mid-post for long content
- Bluesky: End of thread or standalone follow-up post
- Reddit: End of post, after providing value first
- YouTube: Description (top 2 lines), pinned comment, in-video mention

### Encouraging Engagement

**Question Types That Work:**
- **Open-ended:** "What's your favorite creaturepunk setting?"
- **Either/or:** "Would you rather fight 100 tiny creatures or 1 huge creature?"
- **Fill in blank:** "Dimm City is like _____ meets _____"
- **Hot takes:** "Unpopular opinion: [controversial game design take]"
- **Predictions:** "What do you think we're revealing tomorrow?"
- **Personal experience:** "Tell us about your worst TPK"

**Post Formats That Drive Engagement:**
- Polls and votes
- "Tag someone who..." 
- Contests and challenges
- Behind-the-scenes peeks
- AMA (Ask Me Anything)
- Sneak peeks and teasers
- Community spotlights

### Building Community Connection

**Make People Feel Seen:**

## Dealing With Difficult Situations

### The Angry Backer

**Situation:** Backer is upset about [delay/decision/change]

**Response Framework:**
1. Acknowledge feelings: "I understand your frustration"
2. Take responsibility: "We should have communicated this better"
3. Explain (don't excuse): "Here's what happened..."
4. Offer solution: "Here's what we're doing..."
5. Follow up: "I'll check back with you about this"

**Example:**
```
I totally understand your frustration about the timeline change. You backed us trusting we'd deliver on time, and we should have communicated earlier that we were running behind.

Here's what happened: [honest explanation]

What we're doing: [concrete steps]

I know this doesn't fix the delay, but I want you to know we're committed to making this right. If you want to talk more, please DM me directly.

-Matt
```

### The Troll/Bad Faith Actor

**Identifying Trolls:**
- Account created recently
- No post history
- Inflammatory without substance
- Trying to provoke reaction
- Attacking people, not ideas

**Response:**
- One polite, brief response maximum
- Don't engage further
- Report if violates platform rules
- Block if harassment continues
- **Never argue or get defensive**

**Example Response:**
```
We appreciate all feedback. If you have specific concerns, feel free to DM us.
```

Then stop responding.

### The Competitor/Someone Copying Ideas

**Situation:** Another creator mimics your campaign or takes your ideas

**Response:**
- Don't call them out publicly (looks petty)
- Focus on what makes YOU unique
- Rally your community around your authentic story
- If they literally copied text/images, handle privately or legally
- Remember: execution matters more than ideas

### The Feature Request You Can't Do

**Situation:** Community asks for feature that's out of scope/budget/timeline

**Response Framework:**
1. Appreciate the suggestion
2. Explain why it's not feasible (briefly)
3. Offer alternative or future possibility
4. Show you value their input

**Example:**
```
This is a really cool idea! We've actually discussed something similar.

The challenge is [brief constraint explanation]. For this campaign, we need to stay focused on [core features] to ship on time.

But we're noting this for potential future expansions! Keep the ideas coming - this is exactly the kind of community feedback that shapes where we go next.
```
