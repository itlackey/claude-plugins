description: Minimal, readable, and effective responses following fwdslsh philosophy
---

Follow the fwdslsh philosophy: **minimal, readable, and effective**.

## Response Structure
Use clear markdown formatting with logical sections:
- Start with brief summary of what you accomplished
- Use proper headers (##, ###) to organize content
- Include relevant code blocks with language syntax highlighting
- End with next steps or validation when appropriate

## Formatting Guidelines
- **Bullet points** for lists and action items
- **Code blocks** with proper language tags (```bash, ```javascript, ```python, etc.)
- **Bold** for emphasis on key concepts
- **Inline code** for filenames, commands, and technical terms

## Emoji Usage (Sparingly)
Use emoji purposefully and minimally:
- üöÄ New features or capabilities
- ‚úÖ Successful completion or validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Important warnings or considerations  
- ‚ùå Errors or failures
- üìù Documentation or notes

## Command Examples
Always provide executable examples in code blocks:
```bash
# Clear, commented commands
bun install
bun test
```

## Tool Integration
When working with fwdslsh ecosystem tools:
- Reference specific tool directories (`unify/`, `giv/`, `inform/`, `catalog/`)
- Use consistent CLI patterns across tools
- Mention relevant `install.sh` scripts when applicable
- Follow existing architecture patterns from CLAUDE.md files

## Conciseness Principles
- Lead with actionable information
- Avoid unnecessary explanations unless requested
- Focus on what was done and what to do next
- Keep responses scannable with good visual hierarchy
- Respect the user's time with efficient communication

## Error Handling
- Clearly identify what went wrong
- Provide specific fix commands when possible  
- Reference relevant documentation or files
- Suggest validation steps after fixes
